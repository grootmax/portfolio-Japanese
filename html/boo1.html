            <h1>How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie</h1>
            <h2>Why Carnegie’s Advice Still Matters</h2>
            <p>In 1936, Dale Carnegie made a compelling statement to his readers: “Dealing with
               people is probably the biggest problem you face.” This is the foundation of How to
               Win Friends and Influence People, and it is still true today. However, developing
               strategies for dealing with people is more complex.
              </p>
          
            <p>Messaging speed is instantaneous. Communication media have multiplied.
               Networks have expanded beyond borders, industries, and ideologies. Yet rather than
               making the principles in this book obsolete, these major changes have made
               Carnegie’s principles more relevant than ever. They represent the foundation of
               every sound strategy, whether you are marketing a brand, apologizing to your
               spouse, or pitching to investors. And if you don’t begin with the right foundation, it
               is easy to send the wrong message, to offend, or to fall embarrassingly short of your
               objective. “Precision of communication,” insisted American writer James Thurber,
               “is important, more important than ever, in our era of hair-trigger balances, when a
               false, or misunderstood, word may create as much disaster as a sudden thoughtless
               act.”</p>
          
            <p>Every word, every nonverbal cue, every silent
              stare is scrutinized as it has never been before. One wrong move can have far greater
              implications. Still, every interaction from your first good morning to your last
              goodnight is an opportunity to win friends and influence others in a positive way.
              Those who succeed daily lead quite successful lives. But this sort of success comes at
              a philanthropic price some aren’t willing to pay. It is not as simple as being ad-wise
              or savvy about social media,“The art of communication is the language of leadership,” said the presidential
              speechwriter James Humes. </p>
          
            <p>“You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in
              other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you.”
              Carnegie’s assertion remains relevant, albeit counterintuitive, because it reminds us
              the secret to progress with people is a measure of selflessness swept under the drift of
              the digital age.
              </p>
          
            <p>We live in an unprecedented era of self-help and self-promotion. We watch
              YouTube videos like the Double Rainbow go viral in a matter of weeks and garner
              the sort of global attention people used to break their backs for years, even decades,
              to obtain.We
              watch talking heads and political pundits tear down their competition and elevate
              their ratings. We are daily tempted to believe that the best publicity strategy is a mix
              of gimmick and parody run through the most virally proficient medium. The
              temptation is too much for many. But for those who understand the basics of
              human relations, there is a far better, far more reputable, far more sustainable way
              to operate.
              While self-help and self-promotion are not inherently deficient pursuits,
              problems always arise when the stream of self-actualization is dammed within us.
              You are one in seven billion—your progress is not meant for you alone.</p>
          
            <p>Communication is simply an outward manifestation of our thoughts, our
              intentions, and our conclusions about the people around us. “Out of the overflow
              of the heart the mouth speaks.”
               These internal drivers are the primary differentiator
              between today’s leader and today’s relational leech.
              The two highest levels of influence are achieved when (1) people follow you
              because of what you’ve done for them and (2) people follow you because of who
              you are. In other words, the highest levels of influence are reached when generosity
              and trustworthiness surround your behavior. This is the price of great, sustainable
              impact, whether two or two million people are involved. Yet it is only when
              generosity and trust are communicated artfully and authentically that the benefits
              are mutual.</p>
