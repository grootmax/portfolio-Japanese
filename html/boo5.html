            <h1>The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything by Stephen M.R. Covey</h1>
            <h2>How To Make Them Believe In You:"Trust In Progress".</h2>
            <p>There is one thing that is common to every individual, relationship,
                team, family, organization, nation, economy, and civilization
                throughout the world—one thing which, if removed, will destroy the
                most powerful government, the most successful business, the most
                thriving economy, the most influential leadership, the greatest
                friendship, the strongest character, the deepest love.
                On the other hand, if developed and leveraged, that one thing has
                the potential to create unparalleled success and prosperity in every
                dimension of life. Yet, it is the least understood, most neglected, and
                most underestimated possibility of our time.
                That one thing is trust.
                Trust impacts us 24/7, 365 days a year. It undergirds and affects the
                quality of every relationship, every communication, every work
                project, every business venture, every effort in which we are engaged.
                It changes the quality of every present moment and alters the trajectory
                and outcome of every future moment of our lives—both personally
                and professionally.
              </p>
          
            <p>The 5 Waves of Trust model serves as a metaphor for how trust
                operates in our lives. It begins with each of us personally, continues
                into our relationships, expands into our organizations, extends into our
                marketplace relationships, and encompasses our global society at large.
                This reflects the strength of the “inside-out” approach: to build trust
                with others, we must first start with ourselves.
                The First Wave—Self Trust—is where we learn the foundational
                principle that enables us to establish and sustain trust at all levels. That
                principle iscredibility, or believability. This is where we ask ourselves,
                Am I credible? Am I believable? Am I someone people (including
                myself) can trust?

            <p>The 4 Cores
                of Credibility
                    
                First, that you are a person of integrity—that you are honest and
                congruent, that you have a reputation for being truthful, and that you would
                not lie.
                Second, that you have good intent—that you’re not trying to deceive or
                protect anyone, that you don’t have any hidden motive or agenda that would
                color your testimony.
                Third, that your credentials are excellent, that you do, indeed, have
                expertise, knowledge, skill, and capability in the area in which you are
                called to testify.
                And fourth, that you have a good track record, that you have
                demonstrated your capabilities effectively in other situations in the past,
                that you produce results, and that there is good reason to believe that you
                will do so now.
            </p>
          
            <p>The Second Wave—Relationship Trust—is all about behavior…
                consistentbehavior.
                It’s about learning how to interact with others in ways that increase
                trust and avoid interacting in ways that destroy it.
                More specifically, it’s about the 13 Behaviors that are common to
                high-trust leaders and people throughout the world. These behaviors
                are powerful because:
                They are based on principles that govern trusting relationships.(They
                are not based on fads or techniques or even practices, but rather on
                enduring principles that have proven successful in all thriving
                civilizations throughout time.)
                They grow out of the 4 Cores.(They are based on personal
                credibility—on both character and competence. They flow out of what
                you are, not what you might pretend to be.)
                They are actionable.(They can be implemented immediately.)
                They are universal.(They can be applied in any relationship—with
                your boss, peers, associates, customers, spouse, children, extended
                family, or friends. They can also be applied in any organization—
                business, government, education, medicine, or nonprofit—and in any
                culture, although specific cultural applications may vary.)

            <p>In the Third Wave—Organizational Trust—we will deal with
                establishing trust with internal stakeholders. The focus will be on
                creating alignmentthat will eliminate taxes and increase dividends
                inside the organization.
                In the Fourth Wave—Market Trust—we will deal with establishing
                trust with externalstakeholders. The focus will be on building a
                reputationor brand that inspires trust in the marketplace.
                In the Fifth Wave—Societal Trust—we will talk about building
                trust within society based on the principles of contributionand global
                citizenship that are rapidly becoming recognized as an economic, as
                well as a social, necessity.

            <p>The Smart Trust Matrix can be extremely helpful as both a diagnostic and a
                prescriptive tool.
                With regard to analysis, it’s helpful to consider three vital variables,
                which you can do by asking these questions:
                1. What is theopportunity (the situation or task at hand)?
                2. What is therisk involved?
                What are the possible outcomes?
                What is the likelihood of the outcomes?
                What is the importance and visibility of the outcomes?
                1. What is thecredibility (character/competence) of the people
                involved?</p>
