            <h1>Leadership: The Power of Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman</h1>
            <h2>Who,What,When,Where,Why,How To Lead.</h2>
            <p>There's the question of how a leader can develop further strengths in emotional intelligence(EI).
               Here the good news from brain science in neuroplasticity: The insight that the brain continues to 
                grow and shape itself throughout life. A systematic learning process, Can facilitate
                such leadership development at any point in a career or life.   
                

              </p>
          
            <p>On the positive side, imagine the benefits for the work of being skilled in the basic emotional 
                competencies. Being attuned to the feelings of those we deal with, being able to handle disagreements
                so they do not escalate, having the ability to get into flow states while doing our work. Leadership is 
                not domination, but the art of persuading people to work toward a common goal. And, in terms of managing 
                our own career, There may be nothing more essential than recognizing our deepest feelings about what we do 
                and what changes might make us more truly satisfied with our work.
               
            </p>
          
            <p>In a sense, criticism is one of the most important tasks a manager has. Yet it's also one of 
                the most dreaded and put off. And, too many managers have poorly mastered the crucial art of feedback.
                this deficiency has a great cost: How criticisms are given and received goes a long way in determining
                how satisfied people are with their work, with those they work with, and with those to whom they are 
                responsible.
            
            </p>
          
            <p>Many managers are too wiling to criticize, but frugal with praise, leaving their employees
               feeling that they only hear about how they're doing when they make a mistake. This propensity
               to criticism is compounded by managers who delay giving any feedback at all for long periods.  
              </p>
          
            <p>An artful critique focuses on what a person has done and can do rather reading a mark of character
               into a job poorly done. "A character attack, Calling someone stupid or incompetent misses the point.
               You immediately put him on the defensive, so that he's no longer receptive to what you have to tell
               him about how to do things better". 
            </p>
          
            <p>The higher the rank of a person considered to be a star performer, the more emotional intelligence
               capabilities showed up as the reason for his or her effectiveness. 
            </p>
          
            <p>The above parts are just a few but valuable, the book contains a lot of advice, Make sure to read completely.</p>
