            <h1>7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change by Stephen R. Covey</h1>
            <h2>How a Cycle of Actions Make a Great Change in Life  .</h2>
            <p>OUR CHARACTER, BASICALLY, is a
                composite of our habits. “Sow a
                thought, reap an action; sow an
                action, reap a habit; sow a habit,
                reap a character; sow a character, reap a
                destiny,”
              </p>
          
            <p>Habits are powerful factors in our
                lives. Because they are consistent, often
                unconscious patterns, they constantly,
                daily, express our character and produce
                our effectiveness... or ineffectiveness.
                As Horace Mann, the great educator,
                once said, “Habits are like a cable. We
                weave a strand of it everyday and soon
                it cannot be broken.” I personally do not
                agree with the last part of his
                expression. I know they can be broken.
                Habits can be learned and unlearned.
                But I also know it isn’t a quick fix. It
                involves a process and a tremendous
                commitment.
                </p>
          
            <p>Those of us who watched the lunar
                voyage of Apollo 11 were transfixed as
                we saw the first men walk on the moon
                and return to earth. Superlatives such as
                “fantastic” and “incredible” were
                inadequate to describe those eventful
                days. But to get there, those astronauts
                literally had to break out of the
                tremendous gravity pull of the earth.
                More energy was spent in the first few
                minutes of lift-off, in the first few miles
                of travel, than was used over the next
                several days to travel half a million
                miles.</p>
          
            <p>Habits, too, have tremendous gravity
                pull—more than most people realize or
                would admit. Breaking deeply imbedded
                habitual tendencies such as
                procrastination, impatience, criticalness,
                o r selfishness that violate basic
                principles of human effectiveness
                involves more than a little willpower
                and a few minor changes in our lives.
                “Lift off” takes a tremendous effort, but
                once we break out of the gravity pull,
                our freedom takes on a whole new
                dimension.
              </p>
          
            <p>Like any natural force, gravity pull can
                work with us or against us. The gravity
                pull of some of our habits may currently
                be keeping us from going where we want
                to go. But it is also gravity pull that
                keeps our world together, that keeps the
                planets in their orbits and our universe
                in order. It is a powerful force, and if
                we use it effectively, we can use the
                gravity pull of habit to create the
                cohesiveness and order necessary to
                establish effectiveness in our lives.Knowledge is the theoretical
                paradigm, the what to do and the why.
                Skill is the how to do. And desire is the
                motivation, the want to do. In order to
                make something a habit in our lives, we
                have to have all three.
            </p>
          
            <p>It’s sometimes a painful process. It’s a
                change that has to be motivated by a
                higher purpose, by the willingness to
                subordinate what you think you want
                now for what you want later. But this
                process produces happiness, “the object
                and design of our existence.” Happiness
                can be defined, in part at least, as the
                fruit of the desire and ability to sacrifice
                what we want now for what we want
                eventually.</p>
