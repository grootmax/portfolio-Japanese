            <h1>The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work by Shawn Achor.</h1>
            <h2>Who,What,When,Where,Why,How to be Happy.</h2>
            <p>Scientists discovered more proof that happiness
                causes success when they started examining how positive emotions affect our brain
                function and change our behavior. Psychologists have long known that negative
                emotions narrow our thoughts and range of actions, which has served an important
                evolutionary purpose. In prehistoric times, if a saber-toothed tiger was running at you,
                fear and stress helped release chemicals that either prepared you to fight the tiger
                (which admittedly might not go very well) or flee from him (a contest you again might
                lose). Still, these were both better options than doing nothing and simply waiting to be
                attacked. So what evolutionary purpose would positive emotions have? Until recently,
                scientists were content to say that happiness merely makes us feel good, and end the
                inquiry there.
              </p>
          
            <p>Extensive research has found that
                happiness actually has a very important evolutionary purpose, something Barbara
                Fredrickson has termed the “Broaden and Build Theory.” Instead of narrowing our
                actions down to fight or flight as negative emotions do, positive ones broaden the
                amount of possibilities we process, making us more thoughtful, creative, and open to
                new ideas. For instance, individuals who are “primed”—meaning scientists help evoke a
                certain mindset or emotion before doing an experiment—to feel either amusement or
                contentment can think of a larger and wider array of thoughts and ideas than individuals
                who have been primed to feel either anxiety or anger. And when positive emotions
                broaden our scope of cognition and behavior in this way, they not only make us more
                creative, they help us build more intellectual, social, and physical resources we can rely
                upon in the future.
                </p>
          
            <p>More important still than believing in your own abilities is believing that you can improve
                these abilities. Few people have proven this theory more convincingly than Stanford
                psychologist Carol Dweck, whose studies show that whether or not someone believes
                their intelligence is changeable directly affects their achievement. Dweck found that
                people can be split into two categories: Those with a “fixed mindset” believe that their
                capabilities are already set, while those with a “growth mindset” believe that they can
                enhance their basic qualities through effort. A growth mindset is not dismissive of innate
                ability; it merely recognizes, as Dweck explains, that “although people may differ in every
                which way—in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments—everyone
                can change and grow through application and experience.” Her research has shown
                that people with fixed mindsets miss choice opportunities for improvement and
                consistently underperform, while those with a “growth mindset” watch their abilities move
                ever upward.

            <p>Everyone knows someone stuck in some version of the Tetris Effect—someone who is
                unable to break a pattern of thinking or behaving. Often, this pattern can be negative.
                The friend who walks into any room and immediately finds the one thing to complain
                about. The boss who focuses on what an employee continues to do wrong, instead of
                how he’s improving. The colleague who predicts doom before every meeting, no matter
                the circumstances. You know the type. Maybe you’re even one of them.
                
              </p>
          
            <p>The human brain is constantly creating and revising mental maps to help us navigate our
                way through this complex and ever-changing world—kind of like a tireless, overeager
                cartographer. This tendency has been wired in us through thousands of years of
                evolution: In order to survive, we must create physical maps of our environment, map out
                strategies for getting food, and map out the possible effects of our actions. But
                these maps aren’t just crucial to survival in the wilderness, they are vital to succeeding
                and thriving in the business world.

            <p>The concept of the Zorro Circle is a powerful metaphor for how we can achieve our most
                ambitious goals in our jobs, our careers, and our personal lives. One of the biggest
                drivers of success is the belief that our behavior matters; that we have control over our
                future. Yet when our stresses and workloads seem to mount faster than our ability to
                keep up, feelings of control are often the first things to go, especially when we try to
                tackle too much at once. If, however, we first concentrate our efforts on small
                manageable goals, we regain the feeling of control so crucial to performance. By first
                limiting the scope of our efforts, then watching those efforts have the intended effect, we
                accumulate the resources, knowledge, and confidence to expand the circle, gradually
                conquering a larger and larger area. Don Diego didn’t teach young Alejandro how to be
                a swashbuckling swordsman overnight. Zorro started small, then little by little mastered
                his ever-widening circle. His legendary success followed from there.</p>
