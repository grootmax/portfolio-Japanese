            <h1>The Art of War
                By Sun Tzu</h1>
            <h2>Who,What,When,Where,Why,How.</h2>
            <p>Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the
                State.
                It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
                ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account
                be neglected.
                The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to
                be taken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to
                determine the conditions obtaining in the field.
                These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The
                Commander; (5) Method and discipline.
              </p>
          
            <p>The moral law causes the people to be in complete accord
                with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of
                their lives, undismayed by any danger.</p>
          
            <p>Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and
                seasons.</p>
          
            <p>Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and
                security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life
                and death.
              </p>
          
            <p>The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely,
                benevolence, courage and strictness. [The five cardinal virtues
                of the Chinese are (1) humanity or benevolence; (2)
                uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control, or “proper
                feeling;” (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here
                “wisdom” and “sincerity” are put before “humanity or
                benevolence,” and the two military virtues of “courage” and
                “strictness” substituted for “uprightness of mind” and
                “self-respect, self-control, or ‘proper feeling.’”]</p>
          
            <p>Method and Discipline are to be understood the
                marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the
                graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of
                roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control
                of military expenditure.</p>
          
            <p>The above parts are just a few but valuable, the book contains a lot of advice, Make sure to read completely.</p>
