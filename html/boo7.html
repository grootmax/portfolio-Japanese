            <h1>Influencer: The New Science of Leading Change by Kerry Patterson</h1>
            <h2>High Key Role In A LOKI World.</h2>
            <p>Leadership calls for changing people’s behavior. Influencers are those
                leaders who understand how to create rapid, profound, and sustainable
                behavior change. Influencers do three things better than others. They are clearer about the
                results they want to achieve and how they will measure them. They focus on
                a small number of vital behaviors that will help them achieve those results.
                They overdetermine change by amassing six sources of influence that both
                motivate and enable the vital behaviors. Not all moments are created equal. Influencers focus on helping people
                change a small number of high-leverage behaviors during crucial moments.
                
              </p>
          
            <p>Influencers don’t randomly succeed at creating
                impressive and lasting changes in human behavior. The good news is that if they
                did rely on chance, we wouldn’t have a clue how to replicate their efforts. But
                they don’t rely on chance. Instead, they count on three keys to success—keys
                that all influencers adhere to and that you can use to your own benefit:
                1. Focus and measure. Influencers are crystal clear about the result they are
                trying to achieve and are zealous about measuring it.
                2. Find vital behaviors. Influencers focus on high-leverage behaviors that
                drive results. More specifically, they focus on the two or three vital actions
                that produce the greatest amount of change.
                3. Engage all six sources of influence. Finally, influencers break from the
                pack by overdetermining change. Where most of us apply a favorite
                influence tool or two to our important challenges, influencers identify all
                of the varied forces that are shaping the behavior they want to change and
                then get them working for rather than against them. And now for the really
                good news. According to our research, by getting six different sources of
                influence to work in their favor, influencers increase their odds of success
                tenfold.</p>
          
            <p>Successful influencers escape such debacles. They avoid spending time and
                effort on the wrong behaviors by drawing from the following four vital behavior
                search strategies:
                • Notice the obvious. Recognize behaviors that are obvious (or at least
                obvious to experts) but underused.
                • Look for crucial moments. Find times when behavior puts success at
                risk.
                • Learn from positive deviants. Distinguish behaviors that set apart
                positive deviants— those who live in the same world but somehow
                produce much better results.
                • Spot culture busters. Find behaviors that reverse stubborn cultural norms
                and taboos.</p>
          
            <p>Virtually all forces that have
                an impact on human behavior work on only two basic drivers of behavior. Not
                thousands. Just two. At the end of the day a person asks, “Can I do what’s
                required?” and, “Will it be worth it?” The first question simply asks, “Am I
                able?” The second, “Am I motivated?” Consequently, no matter the number of
                forces that affect human action—from managing peer pressure 
                all these strategies work in one of
                two ways. They either motivate or enable a vital behavior. Some do both.
                
              </p>
          
            <p>Personal Motivation:
                Influencers help people change how they feel about vital behaviors by
                connecting them with human consequences both through direct experience
                and through potent stories.
                Personal Ability:
                New behavior requires new skills. Overinvest in helping people learn how to
                master skills and emotions.
                Social Motivation:
                Harness the power of social influence by engaging leaders and opinion
                leaders in encouraging vital behaviors.

                Social Ability:
                People need more than just encouragement; they often need help in order to
                change how they act during crucial moments.

                Structural Motivation:
                Modestly and intelligently reward early successes. Punish only when
                necessary. Be sure to use incentives third, not first.

                Structural Ability:
                Change people’s physical surroundings to make good behavior easier and 
                bad behavior harder.
                Influence doesn’t come by accident. It comes through careful diagnosis,
                patient testing, and eventual success with all three keys to influence.
